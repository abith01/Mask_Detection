# Face Mask Detection Project


A real-time face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to help ensure public safety and compliance with health guidelines. The system can distinguish between individuals wearing masks and those without masks, providing timely alerts for necessary actions.

Key Features
Real-time Detection: The system detects faces in real-time video streams and classifies them as "Mask" or "No Mask".

Alerts: Different messages are displayed for individuals with masks and those without, indicating whether they are allowed or not.

Robust Performance: The deep learning model is trained to perform well in varying lighting conditions and angles.


Technologies Used: 
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
Deep Learning
Computer Vision

Results
The system achieves accurate mask detection even in challenging conditions. It contributes to public health by automating the process of monitoring mask compliance in various settings.
